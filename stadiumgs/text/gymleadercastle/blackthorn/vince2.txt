<FACE,10,2>Come face my thoroughly toughened POKéMON!

<FACE,10,2>I can see that you're a skilled trainer. Let's give it a go!

<FACE,10,2>Go a round with me before you shoot for the top!

<FACE,10,2>Go, #26!

<FACE,10,2>#26, get out there!

<FACE,10,2>I'm counting on you, #26!

<FACE,10,2>#26, it's you!

<FACE,10,2>#26, what a chance!

<FACE,10,2>Come back, #26!

<FACE,10,2>Enough, #26!

<FACE,10,1>Way to work, #26!

<FACE,10,1>I tip my hat to you, #26!

<FACE,10,0>Whoa! That was powerful!

<FACE,10,1>Whew, that was electrifying!

<FACE,10,1>Yeah! Popped it where it hurts the most!
That's the idea!

<FACE,10,0>Yikes! Took it where it hurts! 

<FACE,10,0>Whoa, no!

<FACE,10,1>Looking good.

<FACE,10,0>Uh-oh... Hang tough!

<FACE,10,1>And there we have it. Thanks so much!

<FACE,10,0>Ack... My #26...

<FACE,10,1><YAKEDO,2>Heh, sorry about that.

<FACE,10,2><WAZA,113,2>That's LIGHT SCREEN.

<FACE,10,2><WAZA,115,2>That's REFLECT.

<FACE,10,1><MEROMERO,2>Quite elegant, wouldn't you say?

<FACE,10,1>Thanks! I'm sure you'll get tougher, too.

<FACE,10,2>Well, I'd better go look for my next opponent.

<FACE,10,2>You know, you're not necessarily a bad trainer.

<FACE,10,0>I surrender! I was totally defeated!

<FACE,10,2>I'm sorry. I took you for granted, but you are tough after all.

<FACE,10,2>I suppose there must be many tough trainers.

<FACE,10,2>Whew... We must be evenly matched.

<FACE,10,2>Okay. See you some other time.
