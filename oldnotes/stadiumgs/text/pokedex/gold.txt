The seed on its back is filled with
nutrients. The seed grows steadily larger
as its body grows.

Exposure to sunlight adds to its strength.
Sunlight also makes the bud on its back
grow larger.

By spreading the broad petals of its
flower and catching the sun's rays, it fills
its body with power.

The flame on its tail shows the strength
of its life force. If it is weak, the flame
also burns weakly.

It is very hot-headed by nature, so it
constantly seeks opponents. It calms down
only when it wins.

If CHARIZARD becomes furious, the flame
at the tip of its tail flares up in a
whitish-blue color.

The shell is soft when it is born. It soon
becomes so resilient, prodding fingers will
bounce off it.

It is recognized as a symbol of longevity.
If its shell has algae on it, that
WARTORTLE is very old.

It deliberately makes itself heavy so it
can withstand the recoil of the water
jets it fires.

For protection, it releases a horrible
stench from the antenna on its head to
drive away enemies.

Inside the shell, it is soft and weak as it
prepares to evolve. It stays motionless in
the shell.

It collects honey every day. It rubs honey
onto the hairs on its legs to carry it back
to its nest.

Its poison stinger is very powerful. Its
bright-colored body is intended to warn
off its enemies.

Although it is a cocoon, it can move a
little. It can extend its poison barb if it
is attacked.

It can take down any opponent with its
powerful poison stingers. It sometimes
attacks in swarms.

It usually hides in tall grass. Because it
dislikes fighting, it protects itself by
kicking up sand.

It has outstanding vision. However high it
flies, it is able to distinguish the
movements of its prey.

Its well-developed chest muscles make it
strong enough to whip up a gusty
windstorm with just a few flaps.

It eats anything. Wherever food is
available, it will settle down and produce
offspring continuously.

Gnaws on anything with its tough fangs. It
can even topple concrete buildings by
gnawing on them.

It flaps its short wings to flush out
insects from tall grass. It then plucks
them with its stubby beak.

It shoots itself suddenly high into the
sky, then plummets down in one fell swoop
to strike its prey.

It can freely detach its jaw to swallow
large prey whole. It can become too heavy
to move, however.

Transfixing prey with the face-like
pattern on its belly, it binds and poisons
the frightened victim.

This intelligent POKéMON roasts hard
BERRIES with electricity to make them
tender enough to eat.

When its electricity builds, its muscles are
stimulated, and it becomes more aggressive
than usual.

If it fell from a great height, this
POKéMON could save itself by rolling into
a ball and bouncing.

In an attempt to hide itself, it will run
around at top speed to kick up a blinding
dust storm.

The poison hidden in its small horn is
extremely potent. Even a tiny scratch can
have fatal results.

When feeding its young, it first chews and
tenderizes the food, then spits it out for
the offspring.

Its body is covered with needle-like
scales. It never shows signs of shrinking
from any attack.

It is small, but its horn is filled with
poison. It charges then stabs with the
horn to inject poison.

It raises its big ears to check its
surroundings. If it senses anything, it
attacks immediately.

It swings its big tail around during battle.
If its foe flinches, it will charge with its
sturdy body.

The moonlight that it stores in the wings
on its back apparently gives it the ability
to float in midair.

With its acute hearing, it can pick up
sounds from far away. It usually hides in
quiet places.

As it develops, its single white tail gains
color and splits into six. It is quite warm
and cuddly.

Some legends claim that each of its nine
tails has its own unique type of special
mystical power.

If it inflates to SING a lullaby, it can
perform longer and cause sure drowsiness 
in its audience.

Their fur feels so good that if
two of them snuggle together,
they won't want to be separated.

While flying, it constantly emits ultrasonic
waves from its mouth to check its
surroundings.

However hard its victim's hide may be, it
punctures with sharp fangs and gorges
itself with blood.

Awakened by moonlight, it roams actively
at night. In the day, it stays quietly
underground.

What appears to be drool is actually sweet
honey. It is very sticky and clings
stubbornly if touched.

It has the world's largest petals. With
every step, the petals shake out heavy
clouds of toxic pollen.

It is doused with mushroom spores when it
is born. As its body grows, mushrooms
sprout from its back.

It stays mostly in dark, damp places, the
preference not of the bug, but of the big
mushrooms on its back.

Its eyes also function as radar units. It
catches and eats small bugs that hide in
darkness.

When it attacks, it flaps its large wings
violently to scatter its poisonous powder
all around.

Its skin is very thin. If it is exposed to
light, its blood heats up, causing it to
grow weak.

Its three heads bob separately up and
down to loosen the soil nearby, making it
easier for it to burrow.

It is fascinated by round objects. It
can't stop playing with them until it tires
and falls asleep.

Many adore it for its sophisticated air.
However, it will lash out and scratch for
little reason.

It has mystical powers but doesn't recall
that it has used them. That is why it
always looks puzzled.

When it swims at full speed using its long,
webbed limbs, its forehead somehow begins
to glow.

It is extremely ill-tempered. Groups of
them will attack any handy target for no
reason.

If approached while asleep, it may awaken
and angrily give chase in a groggy state of
semi-sleep.

It has a brave and trustworthy nature. It
fearlessly stands up to bigger and
stronger foes.

This legendary Chinese POKéMON is
considered magnificent. Many people are
enchanted by its grand mane.

Because it is inept at walking on its newly
grown legs, it always swims around in
water.

The swirl on its belly subtly undulates.
Staring at it may gradually cause
drowsiness.

This strong and skilled swimmer is even
capable of crossing the Pacific Ocean just
by kicking.

It senses impending attacks and
TELEPORTs away to safety before the
actual attacks can strike.

It possesses strong spiritual power. The
more danger it faces, the stronger its
psychic power.

Closing both its eyes heightens all its
other senses. This enables it to use its
abilities to their extremes.

Always brimming with power, it passes time
by lifting boulders. Doing so makes it even
stronger.

It always goes at its full power, but this
very tough and durable POKéMON
never gets tired.

It quickly swings its four arms to rock its
opponents with ceaseless punches and
chops from all angles.

Even though its body is extremely skinny,
it is blindingly fast when catching its
prey.

Even though it is filled with ACID, it does
not melt because it also oozes a
neutralizing fluid.

ACID that has dissolved many prey
becomes sweeter, making it even more
effective at attracting prey.

When the tide goes out, dehydrated
TENTACOOL remains can be found
washed up on the shore.

Its 80 tentacles absorb water and stretch
almost endlessly to CONSTRICT its prey
and enemies.

Most people may not notice, but a closer
look should reveal that there are many
GEODUDE around.

With a free and uncaring nature, it doesn't
mind if pieces break off while it rolls down
mountains.

It sheds its skin once a year. The
discarded shell immediately hardens and
crumbles away.

It is a weak runner immediately after
birth. It gradually becomes faster by
chasing after its parents.

At full gallop, its four hooves barely touch
the ground because it moves so incredibly
fast.

It lazes vacantly near water. If
something bites its tail, it won't even
notice for a whole day.

If the tail-biting SHELLDER is thrown off
in a harsh battle, it reverts to being an
ordinary SLOWPOKE.

It is attracted by electromagnetic waves.
It may approach trainers if they are using
their POKéGEAR.

Three MAGNEMITE are linked by a strong
magnetic force. Earaches will occur if you
get too close.

If anyone tries to disturb where the
essential plant sticks grow, it uses its
own stick to thwart them.

By alternately raising and lowering its two
heads, it balances itself to be more stable
while running.

It collects data and plans three times as
wisely, but it may think too much and
become immobilized.

Although it can't walk well on land, it is a
graceful swimmer. It especially loves being
in frigid seas.

Its streamlined body has little drag in
water. The colder the temperature, the
friskier it gets.

As it moves, it loses bits of its body from
which new GRIMER emerge. This worsens
the stench around it.

They love to gather in smelly areas where
sludge accumulates, making the stench
around them worse.

It swims facing backward by opening and
closing its two-piece shell. It is
surprisingly fast.

Once it slams its shell shut, it is impossible
to open, even by those with superior
strength.

With its gas-like body, it can sneak into
any place it desires. However, it can be
blown away by wind.

In total darkness, where nothing is
visible, HAUNTER lurks, silently stalking
its next victim.

It steals heat from its surroundings.
If you feel a sudden chill, it is certain
that a GENGAR appeared.

It twists and squirms through the ground.
The thunderous roar of its tunneling
echoes a long way.

If you think that you had a good dream,
but you can't remember it, a DROWZEE has
probably eaten it.

When it is very hungry, it puts humans it
meets to sleep, then it feasts on their
dreams.

If it senses danger approaching, it cloaks
itself with bubbles from its mouth so it will
look bigger.

It can hardly lift its massive, overgrown
pincer. The pincer's size makes it difficult
to aim properly.

It rolls to move. If the ground is uneven,
a sudden jolt from hitting a bump can
cause it to explode.

It is dangerous. If it has too much
electricity and has nothing to do, it
amuses itself by exploding.

The shell is very durable. Even if it
cracks, it can survive without spilling the
contents.

Its three heads think independently.
However, they are friendly and never
appear to squabble.

If it is sad or lonely, the skull it wears
shakes, and emits a plaintive and mournful
sound.

It has been seen pounding boulders with
the bone it carries in order to tap out
messages to others.

This amazing POKéMON has an awesome
sense of balance. It can kick in succession
from any position.

Its punches slice the air. However, it
seems to need a short break after
fighting for three minutes.

Its tongue has well-developed nerves that
run to the very tip, so it can be deftly
manipulated.

Its thin, filmy body is filled with gases
that cause constant sniffles, coughs and
teary eyes.

If one of the twin KOFFING inflates, the
other one deflates. It constantly mixes
its poisonous gases.

It is inept at turning because of its four
short legs. It can only charge and run in
one direction.

Its rugged hide protects it from even the
heat of lava. However, the hide also makes
it insensitive.

It walks carefully to prevent its egg from
breaking. However, it is extremely fast at
running away.

The vines that cloak its entire body are
always jiggling. They effectively unnerve
its foes.

If it is safe, the young gets out of the
belly pouch to play. The adult keeps a close
eye on the youngster.

If attacked by a larger enemy, it quickly
swims to safety by adeptly controlling its
dorsal fin.

An examination of its cells revealed the
presence of a gene not found in HORSEA.
It became a hot topic.

Its dorsal, pectoral and tail fins wave
elegantly in water. That is why it is known
as the water dancer.

During spawning season, SEAKING gather
from all over, coloring the rivers a
brilliant red.

At night, the center of its body slowly
flickers with the same rhythm as a human
heartbeat.

The center section of its body is called
the core. It glows in a different color
each time it is seen.

A skilled mime from birth, it gains the
ability to create invisible objects as it
matures.

It slashes through grass with its sharp
scythes, moving too fast for the human
eye to track.

It rocks its body rhythmically. It appears
to alter the rhythm depending on how it is
feeling.

Electricity runs across the surface of its
body. In darkness, its entire body glows a
whitish-blue.

It dislikes cold places, so it blows
scorching flames to make the environment
suitable for itself.

With its horns, it digs burrows to sleep in
at night. In the morning, damp soil clings
to its body.

They fight each other by locking horns.
The herd's protector takes pride in its
battle-scarred horns.

An underpowered, pathetic POKéMON. It
may jump high on rare occasions, but never
more than seven feet.

They say that during past wars, GYARADOS
would appear and leave blazing ruins in its
wake.

They have gentle hearts. Because they
rarely fight, many have been caught. Their
number has dwindled.

It can transform into anything. When it
sleeps, it changes into a stone to avoid
being attacked.

It has the ability to alter the composition
of its body to suit its surrounding
environment.

When VAPOREON's fins begin to vibrate,
it is a sign that rain will come within a few
hours.

It concentrates the weak electric
charges emitted by its cells and launches
wicked lightning bolts.

It stores some of the air it inhales in its
internal flame pouch, which heats it to
over 3,000 degrees.

It is a manmade POKéMON. Since it
doesn't breathe, people are eager to try
it in any environment.

Revived from an ancient fossil, this
POKéMON uses air stored in its shell
to sink and rise in water.

Apparently, it cracked SHELLDER's shell
with its sharp fangs and sucked out the
insides.

On rare occasions, some have been found
as fossils which they became while hiding
on the ocean floor.

In the water, it tucks in its limbs to
become more compact, then it wiggles its
shell to swim fast.

A vicious POKéMON from the distant past,
it appears to have flown by spreading its
wings and gliding.

What sounds like its cry may actually be
its snores or the rumblings of its hungry
belly.

The magnificent, seemingly translucent
wings of this legendary bird POKéMON are
said to be made of ice.

This legendary bird POKéMON causes
savage thunderstorms by flapping its
glittering wings.

This legendary POKéMON scatters
embers with every flap of its wings. It is a
thrilling sight to behold.

It is born large to start with. It
repeatedly sheds its skin as it steadily
grows longer.

They say that if it emits an aura from its
whole body, the weather will begin to
change instantly.

It is said that this POKéMON constantly
flies over the immense seas and rescues
drowning people.

Because its battle abilities were raised to
the ultimate level, it thinks only of
defeating its foes.

Apparently, it appears only to those
people who are pure of heart and have a
strong desire to see it.

A sweet aroma gently wafts from the leaf
on its head. It is docile and loves to soak
up the sun's rays.

The scent of spices comes from around its
neck. Somehow, sniffing it makes you want
to fight.

The aroma that rises from its petals
contains a substance that calms
aggressive feelings.

It is timid, and always curls itself up in a
ball. If attacked, it flares up its back for
protection.

Be careful if it turns its back during
battle. It means that it will attack with
the fire on its back.

If its rage peaks, it becomes so hot that
anything that touches it will instantly go
up in flames.

Its well-developed jaws are powerful and
capable of crushing anything. Even its
trainer must be careful.

If it loses a fang, a new one grows back in
its place. There are always 48 fangs lining
its mouth.

When it bites with its massive and powerful
jaws, it shakes its head and savagely
tears its victim up.

A very cautious POKéMON, it raises
itself up using its tail to get a better
view of its surroundings.

It makes a nest to suit its long and skinny
body. The nest is impossible for other
POKéMON to enter.

It always stands on one foot. It changes
feet so fast, the movement can rarely be
seen.

Its eyes are specially adapted. They
concentrate even faint light and enable it
to see in the dark.

It is very timid. It will be afraid to move
if it is alone. But it will be active if it is in
a group.

When the stars flicker in the night sky,
it flutters about, scattering a glowing
powder.

It lies still in the same pose for days in
its web, waiting for its unsuspecting prey
to wander close.

It spins string not only from its rear but
also from its mouth. It is hard to tell
which end is which.

It flies so silently through the dark on its
four wings that it may not be noticed even
when nearby.

It shoots positive and negative
electricity between the tips of its two
antennae and zaps its enemies.

The light it emits is so bright that it can
illuminate the sea's surface from a depth
of over three miles.

It is not yet skilled at storing
electricity. It may send out a jolt if
amused or startled.

Because of its unusual, star-like
silhouette, people believe that it came
here on a meteor.

It has a very soft body. If it starts to
roll, it will bounce all over and be
impossible to stop.

The shell seems to be filled with joy. It is
said that it will share good luck when
treated kindly.

They say that it will appear before
kindhearted, caring people and shower
them with happiness.

Because its wings aren't yet fully grown,
it has to hop to get around. It is always
staring at something.

They say that it stays still and quiet
because it is seeing both the past and
future at the same time.

If static electricity builds in its body, its
fleece doubles in volume. Touching it will
shock you.

As a result of storing too much
electricity, it developed patches where
even downy wool won't grow.

The tail's tip shines brightly and can be
seen from far away. It acts as a beacon
for lost people.

BELLOSSOM gather at times and appear to
dance. They say that the dance is a ritual
to summon the sun.

The tip of its tail, which contains oil that
is lighter than water, lets it swim without
drowning.

By keeping still and listening intently, it
can tell what is in even wild, fast-moving
rivers.

Although it always pretends to be a tree,
its composition appears to be closer to a
rock than a plant.

If POLIWAG and POLIWHIRL hear its
echoing cry, they respond by gathering
from far and wide.

To keep from being blown away by the wind,
they gather in clusters. They do enjoy
gentle breezes, though.

The bloom on top of its head opens and
closes as the temperature fluctuates up
and down.

Once it catches the wind, it deftly
controls its cotton-puff spores to float,
even around the world.

Its tail is so powerful that it can use it
to grab a tree branch and hold itself up in
the air.

It may drop out of the sky suddenly. If
attacked by a SPEAROW, it will violently
shake its leaves.

It converts sunlight into energy. In the
darkness after sunset, it closes its
petals and becomes still.

If it flaps its wings really fast, it can
generate shock waves that will shatter
windows in the area.

This POKéMON lives in cold water. It will
leave the water to search for food when
it gets cold outside.

This carefree POKéMON has an easy-going
nature. While swimming, it always bumps into
boat hulls.

It uses the fine hair that covers its body
to sense air currents and predict its
enemy's actions.

When agitated, this POKéMON protects
itself by spraying poisonous sweat from
its pores.

Feared and loathed by many, it is believed
to bring misfortune to all those who see it
at night.

It has incredible intellect and intuition.
Whatever the situation, it remains calm
and collected.

It likes playing mischievous tricks such as
screaming and wailing to startle people at
night. 

Their shapes look like hieroglyphs on
ancient tablets. It is said that the two
are somehow related.

It hates light and shock. If attacked, it
inflates its body to pump up its counter
strike.

Its tail has a small brain of its own.
Beware! If you get close, it may react to
your scent and bite.

It likes to make its shell thicker by adding
layers of tree bark. The additional weight
doesn't bother it.

Its entire body is shielded by a steel-hard
shell. What lurks inside the armor is a
total mystery.

When spotted, this POKéMON escapes
backward by furiously boring into the
ground with its tail.

It flies straight at its target's face then
clamps down on the startled victim to
inject poison.

Its body has been compressed deep under
the ground. As a result, it is even harder
than a diamond.

Although it looks frightening, it is
actually kind and affectionate. It is very
popular among women.

It is actually timid and easily spooked. If
attacked, it flails about to fend off its
attacker.

To fire its poison spikes, it must inflate
its body by drinking over 2.6 gallons of
water all at once.

It swings its eye patterned pincers up to
scare its foes. This makes it look like it
has three heads.

The BERRIES it stores in its vase like
shell decompose and become a gooey
liquid.

This powerful POKéMON thrusts its prized
horn under its enemies' bellies then lifts
and throws them.

Its paws conceal sharp claws. If
attacked, it suddenly extends the claws
and startles its enemy.

If it finds honey, its crescent mark glows.
It always licks its paws because they are
soaked with honey.

Although it is a good climber, it prefers to
snap trees with its forelegs and eat fallen
BERRIES.

It never sleeps. It has to keep moving
because if it stopped, its magma body
would cool and harden.

The shell on its back is just skin that has
cooled and hardened. It breaks easily with
a slight touch.

It rubs its snout on the ground to find
and dig up food. It sometimes discovers
hot springs.

Because the long hair all over its body
obscures its sight, it just keeps charging
repeatedly.

It continuously sheds and grows. The tip
of its head is prized as a treasure for its
beauty.

It has superb accuracy. The water it
shoots out can strike even moving prey
from more than 300 feet.

It traps enemies with its suction cupped
tentacles then smashes them with its
rock-hard head.

It carries food all day long. There are
tales about lost people who were saved by
the food it had.

As it majestically swims, it doesn't care if
REMORAID attach to it for scavenging its
leftovers.

Its sturdy wings look heavy, but they are
actually hollow and light, allowing it to fly
freely in the sky.

It uses different kinds of cries for
communicating with others of its kind and
for pursuing its prey.

If you are burned by the flames it shoots
from its mouth, the pain will never go
away.

It is said that it usually hides in
underwater caves. It can create
whirlpools by yawning.

It swings its long snout around playfully,
but because it is so strong, that can be
dangerous.

It has sharp, hard tusks and a rugged
hide. Its TACKLE is strong enough to
knock down a house.

This upgraded version of PORYGON is
designed for space exploration. It can't
fly, though.

The curved antlers subtly change the flow
of air to create a strange space where
reality is distorted.

A special fluid oozes from the tip of its
tail. It paints the fluid everywhere to
mark its territory.

It is always bursting with energy. To make
itself stronger, it keeps on fighting even
if it loses.

If you become enchanted by its smooth,
elegant, dance-like kicks, you may get
drilled hard.

Its lips are the most sensitive parts on
its body. It always uses its lips first to
examine things.

It rotates its arms to generate
electricity, but it tires easily, so it
charges up only a little bit.

Each and every time it inhales and exhales,
hot embers dribble out of its mouth and
nostrils.

Its milk is packed with nutrition, making it
the ultimate beverage for the sick or
weary.

Anyone who takes even one bite of
BLISSEY's egg becomes unfailingly caring
and pleasant to everyone.

The rain clouds it carries let it fire
thunderbolts at will. They say that it
descended with lightning.

Volcanoes erupt when it barks. Unable to
restrain its extreme power, it races
headlong around the land.

Said to be the incarnation of northern
winds, it can instantly purify filthy, murky
water.

It feeds on soil. After it has eaten a
large mountain, it will fall asleep so it can
grow.

Its shell is as hard as sheet rock, and it
is also very strong. Its THRASHing can
topple a mountain.

Its body can't be harmed by any sort of
attack, so it is very eager to make
challenges against enemies.

It is said that it quietly spends its time
deep at the bottom of the sea because its
powers are too strong.

Legends claim this POKéMON flies the
world's skies continuously on its
magnificent seven colored wings.

This POKéMON wanders across time.
Grass and trees flourish in the forests in
which it has appeared.
